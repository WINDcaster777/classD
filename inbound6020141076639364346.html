        <p>Hellooo,My name is Aijeleth Frexie O. Masmila.
       
        I am currently in college studying information system. I was born on June 09 2003 at valladolid. My guardian parent is Leda M. Osuya, she is the sister of my biological mom. My guardian parent enrolled me in kindergarten to elementary. I was 6 years old when I was on first grade. My elementary days is incredibly awesome. I gained many friends and as well as enemies ang I got bullied l. But it's totally fine because I have friends to laugh, have fun with and learn with. In 2015 I graduated in elementary and become a high school freshmen in RTNHS. It's great that I have found true friends that same year, and it's quite funny how I always wanted and God gave me super cool and amazing friends and actually treated me like their sister. I had so much fun with them. It's my sophomore year 2017, and the best that I remembered back there is when we ditched class. Year I know its not really a good thing to do but best moment come from worst ideas right? Good friends, competitive teachers and wonderful family are the one who mold me for who I am today. Everything good I have inside of me, I get from them. I experienced a lot of challenges and problems that I've been through leaves a wonderful lesson. Good day give me happiness, Bad day give me experience, which both essential to life. Success keeps me growing and failures makes me humble.</p>

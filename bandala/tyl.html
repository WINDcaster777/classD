    <h1><marquee>"My Autobiography"</marquee></h1>
   
   <p>In this world, many people surround us. Though we all apparently look similar, yet we all are unique in our own ways. The uniqueness gives us an identity. I am a teenage girl. I am like most teenage girls but I am also different from others. Those differences make me who I am.This is Kristyl Marie Bandala I was born on July 9, 2003 in Valladolid Brgy.Alijis. I grew up living in Hinigaran, graduated from elementary school and High school in Hinigaran National high school and then I later moved to Bago City started my senior high school in Bago City Senior High School Standalone and continuing my study in I-tech college Bago city and getting a course of Bachelor of science in Information System.Ever since I was a child, I would always see my parents working hard for me  to get what I desire and they have always supported me with comfort whenever I needed help or had to overcome a certain obstacle. Even if it is hard for my parents to provide me with all the materials I need, they would try their very best to make me blissful.  <p>
       
   <p>My life has been a roller coaster ride with a lot of up and down moments. My roller coaster ride helped to realize what I wanted to study in college. I feel that I have a strong passion about taking care of people; I want to learn everything that I could, so I could be able to assist people. Everyone is passionate about a certain aspects of life, but I’m very passionate about my career. A passion is a strong feeling and sometime a controllable emotion that can make a difference in someone work ethic. During my career I want to be able to make a difference in other people lives. My passion for helping people came from my family experience, educational, work, and career goals.
   
   <p> I feel that the passion that I have for helping people.I went through a lot of bad experiences that make think what I could study in college. All the time I used to tell myself that I’m going to make sure that other kids will not go through what I went. All my experiences also helped me to be independent. All my struggles; weeks without sleep, being neglected from my own family made me a stronger person.Life is full of experiences. Every moment we meet different people and face different situations. In this course of life, we not only get to know different people, but we also get to know ourselves in different ways.<p>

<p>As we grow, our likes dislike interest changes. Our perception and outlook toward life also change with time and experience. Thus, the search to the answer to the question of who I am is a lifelong process. <p>

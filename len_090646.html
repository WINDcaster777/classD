    <h1>My Name is Larilyn Panton</h1>
    <p>I am currently in college studying Information System. I was born on 6th of November year 2003, in Escalante City. My parents are Analyn and Larry Panton and I have 4 brothers and 3 sisters
    My parents enrolled me in kindergarten to elementary. I was only 7 years old when I was on the first grade. My elementary days are incredibly awesome. I gained many friends and as well as enemies and I got bullied. But it's totally fine because I have friends to laugh with, have fun with, and learn with.
    In 2016, I graduated from elementary and become a high school freshman in Sum-ag National Highschool. Its great that I found true friends that same year,and its quite funny how I always wanted and God gave me super cool and amazing friends that actually treated me like a sister. I had so much fun with them.
    It's my sophomore year 2017, and the best that I remembered back there is when we ditched class. Yeah, I know it's not really a good thing to do but, best moments come from worst ideas right?
    Good friends, competitive teacher's and wonderful family are the ones who mold me for who I am today. Everything good I have inside of me, I get from them. I experienced lots of challenges and problems that I've been through leaves a wonderful lesson. Good days gave me happiness, bad days gave me experiences, which are both essential to life. success keeps me Growing and failures make me humble.
    Right now, I am a working students of Itech College and I'm studying vert well so if I finished college, I can have a good job in order me to help my family and raise the style of living that we have now with God's grace and guidance. Just always remember that, life is like a rollercoaster. It has ups and downs. But it's your choice to scream or just enjoy the ride.</p>

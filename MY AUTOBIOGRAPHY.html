    <h2>Hi! My name is Kimberly Hope Jacildo. I'm 20 years old and I was born on May 28, 2003 in La Castellana. I am a 2nd year College Student in I-TECH College Bago City currently taking of Bachelor of Science in Information System. I live in La Castellana Negros Occidental. I love writing as I love myself because writing is my way of expressing and sharing my thoughts. I'm not a professional writer. I'm still learning how to be a good writer. I also love watching TikTok and Reading Wattpad Stories. I'm the older among my siblings. I love my family so much because they are the reason why I always smile and laugh. My family is not rich by money but rich by lovableness. My dream in life is to be successful someday and to give the life that I want for my parents. I want to fulfil my dreams to recomply the sacrifice and hardships of my parents. And I want to help my others siblings to finish their schoolings so that they can achieve their dreams and have a good life someday. If I finished my responsibilities on my parents and siblings, I want to enjoy my life and tragvels around the world. But of course, I want to be a successful writer someday and have a collab from other artists all over the world. I want them to know the stories that I made. I want to be known someday as a Best Writer All Over the World. If I achieved my dreams, I want to help some vagrant who needs help. Because I believe that if God give you a good life in the future, you need to return it back to others. But my main goals for now is to graduate in college. In our family i'm the one who has big dream, because I want to be the first millionaire in our family someday. And the best event in my life is, when I born in this world and be my parent's daughter. I believe that if I follow my heart , my dreams will come true.

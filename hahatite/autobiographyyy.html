My name is Andrea Camille Antivola, or also known as Andrea. I was born somewhere in the sock island of the Philippines, particularly known as the island of Negros in May 21, 2004. As of now, I am seventeen years old continuing my studies here in Moonwalk. I enjoy aesthetics such as music and arts. I can play guitar and ukulele however I’m not good at such. I have my own art style that I should be proud of. I play mobile games too for my leisure time. I enjoy watching anime. My favorite genres are soft, cute, sad, weird, creepy, romance and tragedy. I love Ghibli movies so much too.

I went to an all girls catholic highschool which was pretty strict but it made me who I am right now. However, I enjoyed my highschool days so much even though it's hard to say I did because I didn’t experience having a dance with someone on JS Prom. Although, I experienced being punished to clean our garden and library by our previous principal for being late, having fun in joining clubs that creates a celebration every month, checking the color of your bra if its colored or not, cutting long nails on the door because you can't enter the building when it’s not short enough, creating songs for activities, having a single line in one file and etc. Which may seem so lame but it's quite cool and unique because there’s no other school I know doing those. I became religious and disciplined. I remember the first contest I joined, it was a pressure. And I felt disappointed when I only finished in second place. But people around me kept inspiring me to be better and gave me comfort that it was okay because I did not lose. It's either we win or learn.

My life is surely full of serious adjustments, I grew up with my grandparents when they both died. I went back to my parents which was hard. My family broke up and we had to get separated from my father and move into Manila, the new normal, online classes. My father loved me but now he only sees me as his enemy. I came from an all girls catholic school. Now I have male classmates which is so unusual with me but overtime I'll get used to changes. People were like visitors in my life, they came and went. I had a lot of broken friends and I was there for them, but as soon as they were fixed they left me and I’m now the one who’s broken, but it didn't matter since I never failed to make everyone smile.

One big past happening that made my life shift and I would never forget is when I had a gender crisis. I found myself liking a girl and to be honest I had a relationship with her. Being in a catholic school was hard in that kind of situation since it was one of the biggest rules, the rule “NO GIRL TO GIRL RELATIONSHIP”. I had to keep us in private and around the time everyone knew we were criticized. We were embarrassed in front of the whole school. But I never regret being with my ex-girlfriend since she had a big role in who I am right now and what we're going to be. I’m lucky that despite all that happened we’re still friends and we lasted almost 3 years too.

The best three words that would possibly and more likely describe my future is Happiness, Meaning or Purpose, and Death. I do believe that life is a roller-coaster; there's these ups and downs nowadays. I feel so down, I know in my near future I'd be happy, all my sacrifices, pains, loneliness and agony will finally pay off. I would find my meaning or purpose in this life because I know everyone and everything has its own purpose, even pain, even mistakes. Lastly, but definitely not the least; Death, everyone has its own ending, not only in life but also in relationships and many more. Sometimes we just have to accept the fact that we are all going to end or die. No one knows what will happen after death, some say there is life after death, and some may say there is reincarnation. For me it isn't that important, the important thing is you have lived a happy and righteous life and you have found the purpose of your existence.
